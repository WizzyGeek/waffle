# WAFLE

Wafle is an awesome way to transform iterables

## Goals
 - Minimal overhead
 - **Zero iteration overhead**
 - Concise syntax
 - Intuitive usage
 - Compatibility with other iterator tools and some other abstractions
 - Ability to produce one-liners for most transformations over data
 - Type-safe
 - IDE support, no black magic and remain statically analyzable
